# split_bill_in_c

My assignment was to calculate half of a restaurant bill. 

I was directed that the tax should be added to the bill amount before calculating the tip and that I should return exactly half of the full amount, including the bill amount, the tax and the tip.

// Data types, operations, type casting, return value

My function needed to use the input parameters, bill, tax, and tip, to calculate the final amount. However, since these values are percentages, I had to convert these to more appropriate formats to use for my calculation

// I was given the following hints based on the code they provided in the original problem.

1. Note that the tax and tip are input as percents. You may want to change these to decimal values before calculating the total.
2. Since the tip is input as an int, keep in mind that if you divide an int by an int youâ€™ll get back an int!
3. Order of operations here is exactly the same as in algebra, where multiplcation and division are performed before addition and subtraction.
